# Format suggestions

Pok√©mon Showdown's list of formats (playable game types) comes from these four places:

- Nintendo's in-game matchmaking formats (Battle Stadium, Global Battle Union, etc)
    - Examples: Battle Stadium Singles

- Smogon's Other Metagames formats
    - Examples: STABmons

Nintendo's formats can't be controlled by us, of course. Asking us to change them isn't possible, because we don't control them.

Smogon's Other Metagames formats, on the other hand, is the home for creative user-suggested formats. Rules changes for them can be freely discussed in Smogon's [Other Metagames forum][2].
